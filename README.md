# Stock-Prediction-Project
This project is about Stock Prediction based on Momentum Trading, I have used Machine Learning Techniques like Logistic Regression, GBDT, Random Forest to Predict/Recommend the right time to take an Entry or Exit from the stock market for a particular stock.
From data cleaning to data preprocessing, Exploratory data analysis,everything is clearly mentioned in the ipython notebook.
For explainable AI, I have used LIME technique to understand why a partiuclar algorithm is giving a particular result so that there will be interpretablity about the model.

This Project is a part of my internship at Dimensions & Fact Solutions Private Limited(UK), The company is currently working on the stock market entry exit predictions, we have also deployed this project on a web app, where we used StreamLit as a Front end and Google Cloud Platform as a Backend.

I am not sharing the link of app here because i dont want people to use the app for real time trading, This web app is still in a very early stage and it may lead to wrong decisions.

Still if somebody wants to see this for educational or recruitment purpose, please drop a mail on "iamnishesh21@gmail.com".
