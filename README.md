# Stock-Prediction-Project
This project is about Stock Prediction based on Momentum Trading, I have used Machine Learning Techniques like Logistic Regression, GBDT, Random Forest to Predict/Recommend the right time to take an Entry or Exit from the stock market for a particular stock.
From data cleaning to data preprocessing, Exploratory data analysis,everything is clearly mentioned in the ipython notebook.
For explainable AI, I have used LIME technique to understand why a partiuclar algorithm is giving a particular result so that there will be interpretablity about the model.

I have also deployed the whole model on the streamlit app as front end and AWS server as backend to see the Real-Time Predictions by the model, I have also provided the link of streamlit app.
